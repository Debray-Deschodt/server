you can list the process that listen this port with:
sudo lsof -i :3000

and then kill it with :
kill -9 //PID

where you replace //PID by the process ID.

ssh debian@149.202.54.101 -p 61487
ssh debian@149.202.54.101 -p 61487

every tree month : sudo chown debian -R /etc/letsencrypt
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo service apache2 stop
it's for permission access denied
there's maybe better solutions
