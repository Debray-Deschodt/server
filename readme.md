you can list the process that listen this port with:
sudo lsof -i :3000

and then kill it with :
kill -9 //PID

where you replace //PID by the process ID.

ssh ubuntu@149.202.54.101 -p 61487
ytjDd4Xcc3g8

every tree month : sudo chown ubuntu -R /etc/letsencrypt
it's for permission access denied
there's maybe better solutions
